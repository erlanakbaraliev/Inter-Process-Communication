Election. In Hungary there are several electoral districts. In each district there is an electoral 
committee, which protects the legality of voting. The committee has got three members: a 
president and two other people. Usually one of them are checking the identification documents 
of the voters, the other one seals down the electoral paper. (The president will be the parent 
process, the other two members will be child processes.) 
a) The president waits for the signals of each of the children that they are ready for work. After 
that, the president read from the command line argument the number of voters and 
generate a random identification number for each of them. The presidents write the 
numbers into an unnamed pipe and the first child process (checking member) has to read 
them and write to the screen. 
b) The checking member (1st process) checks the identification cards of the voters and in 20% 
of the cases they are not good. The checking child send to the second child the identification 
numbers and the „can vote”/”cannot vote” remark through a named pipe. The second child 
reads the data and writes everything to the screen. 
c) The person who can vote will get the electoral paper and votes. (A random number between 
1..6). The second child writes the result of the voters to a message queue. The president 
reads the message queue and writes everything to the screen.
